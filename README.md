# CNN Digit Classifier
A Digit Classifier using a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) model in PyTorch

All dependencies are contained in the virtual environment. When running ```main.py```, the model will be trained locally on the MNIST dataset. Once trained, users can interact with the pygame window.


Digits can be drawn in the pygame window by clicking and dragging with the mouse cursor, cleared using the ```space``` key, and identified using the ```enter``` key (with predictions being printed to the console).
